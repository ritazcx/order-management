📘 ITIL Severity Framework (High / Medium / Low)
🔴 Severity: High (Critical Business Impact)
Definition

A High severity ticket indicates a critical disruption to business operations, with significant financial, security, or operational risk, and no acceptable workaround.

Business Criteria

A ticket should be classified as High if any of the following is true:

Impact

A business-critical system or service is entirely unavailable
(e.g., ERP, CRM, authentication, payroll, VPN, network core)

A failure that blocks essential business processes
(e.g., cannot manufacture, cannot ship, cannot invoice)

Scope

The issue affects an entire department, multiple teams, or the entire organization

A core infrastructure component is degraded or offline

Risk

Incident poses a security threat, data exposure, or compliance risk

VIP / executive users are blocked in a way that delays business operations

Workarounds

No workaround exists

Users cannot proceed until the issue is resolved

Examples of High

Production system outage

VPN down for the company

Authentication or SSO failure

Server room hardware failure

Security incident with potential breach

Network outage impacting an entire floor or building

🟠 Severity: Medium (Moderate Business Impact)
Definition

A Medium severity ticket represents a partial service degradation or multi-user impact where business operations are slowed but not fully blocked. A workaround may exist, but performance is degraded.

Business Criteria

A ticket belongs to Medium if all the following are true:

Impact

The system is slow, unstable, intermittently failing, or partially functional

The issue affects productivity but does not stop work entirely

Scope

Two or more users are affected
OR

A team/department experiences inconvenience but can continue working

Risk

No immediate security or compliance risk

The issue is operationally inconvenient but not critical

Workarounds

A workaround exists and is acceptable temporarily

Users can still accomplish their tasks with delays, retries, or reduced functionality

Examples of Medium

Wi-Fi intermittent on one floor

CRM search working sometimes but failing intermittently

Shared drives disconnect occasionally

Excel formulas not recalculating for a team

Email delays for several users

🟢 Severity: Low (Low Business Impact / Single User)
Definition

A Low severity ticket has minimal business impact, typically affecting only a single user or involving non-critical functionality, cosmetic issues, or routine administrative requests.

Business Criteria

A ticket should be Low if all the following are true:

Impact

No business process is significantly impaired

The issue is minor, cosmetic, or annoying but not blocking work

Scope

One user is affected

Issue does not impact teams or departments

Risk

No security, compliance, or financial risk

No operational urgency

Workarounds

Work can continue without significant degradation

The impact is tolerable for days or weeks

Examples of Low

Password reset

Access request

Printer jam for a single person

Mouse / keyboard / monitor issues

General inquiries (“How do I…?”)

Small Excel issues for one person

UI bugs that do not affect productivity
